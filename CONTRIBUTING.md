# eadrax contribution guide

## General rules

* Respect for each other and respect for our values (see below).
* The developer guide introduces every tool and framework. Use it, and extend it! Therefore, have a look at it before every new milestone is started!
* Without review, no code is taken to master-branch. Only maintainer can perform reviews and only maintainer can push to master-branch. Therefore, use the processes as described in dev-guide.
* If the maintainer/reviewer is satisfied about the work done, an extra bonus is granted afterwards. One and only rule: anything to please the maintainer. This is absolutely subjective intentionally. Therefore: ask if you don't know how you gain that reward.
* A reward is granted if you recommend and introduce more developers.
* Commit regularly, at least once every working day! This is to make transparent the progress of the project - for the maintainer, the customer and most import: the team itself. Bare in mind that we are a virtual organisation with developers all around the globe, there is no _grapevine_ for remote workers. 

## Our values

* Focus: Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.
* Courage: Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
* Openness: As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed.
* Commitment: Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success. 
* Respect: As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
* Just Barely Good Enough: Is actually the most effective possible, is situational, does not imply low quality, changes over time
